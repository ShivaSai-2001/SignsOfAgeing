# SignsOfAgeing

A model to classify and localize different signs of ageing such as puffy eyes,wrinkles,darkspots,blackspots etc., on the face. 
The Project requires knowledge of various domains use Image Processing techniques to process the image as per requirements.The model 
preferred to work upon is EfficientNet which will detect signs of ageing like puffy eyes,wrinkles,darkspots on te image.It should overlay
bounding boxes around detected ageing signs.

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on June 24, 2021 at 6:07 AM GMT
It includes 312 images. Skinmarks are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.
The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
•	Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
•	Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)
No image augmentation techniques were applied.
To run this project install Python complier called Jupyter Notebbok or Run this project in Google Colab Notebook. Languages : Python

This SignsOfAgeing will be used for clients to identify puffyeyes, wrinkles and darkspots on the input human face easily.


The project aims at localizing the different Signs of aging such as puffy eyes, wrinkles, dark spots etc.. by using ML and DL algorithms. 
Data was further analysed to identify different linguistic cues in detecting signs of ageing . In this project we have only considered image 
datasets for classification. As a future work ,we intend to explore the effect of adding cameras for face  recognition and many other beauty 
aspects(such as    cure for signs of aging etc..) in classification accuracy.
